1.Difference between HTTP/1 and HTTP/2:
•	HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & is used in client-server communication. 

•	By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.
HTTP-1:
	It uses works on the textual format.

	There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
	It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
	It compresses data by itself.
HTTP-2:
•	It works on the binary protocol.
•	It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
•	It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
•	It uses HPACK for data compression.

2. OBJECT AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT :

•	Objects in javascript,is its most important data type and forms the building blocks for modern javascript.

•	These objects are quite different from javascript 's primitive  data-types(Number,string,Boolean,null,undefined and symbol)in the sense that while these primitive data types all store a single value each.

•	Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.

•	An object is a reference data type.variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.
